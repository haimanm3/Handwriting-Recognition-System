## ▶️ How to Use

### 💻 Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
- NetBeans, IntelliJ, or any Java-capable IDE (or use command line)

### 📦 Step 1: Download the Project

- Clone or download the repo and open it in your IDE or extract the files if zipped.

### 🛠 Step 2: Compile the Program

**Using terminal:**
```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java
```

**Or in an IDE:** Right-click project > Build

### ▶️ Step 3: Run the Program

**Using terminal:**
```bash
java -cp bin Main
```

**Or in an IDE:** Right-click `Main.java` > Run

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

- **GUI doesn't open?** Ensure you're running `Main.java`, not individual files.
- **Java errors?** Confirm you're using JDK 8 or higher and files are in the correct structure.
- **Drawing not registering?** Use mouse clicks to fill squares; reset the grid to retry.
